1. Merchants need full CRUD functionality on bulk discounts, and will be accessed a link on the merchant's dashboard.

2. You will implement a percentage based discount:
  5% discount on 20 or more items
3. A merchant can have multiple bulk discounts in the system.

4. When a user adds enough value or quantity of a single item to their cart, the bulk discount will automatically show up on the cart page.

5. A bulk discount from one merchant will only affect items from that merchant in the cart.

6. A bulk discount will only apply to items which exceed the minimum quantity specified in the bulk discount. (eg, a 5% off 5 items or more does not activate if a user is buying 1 quantity of 5 different items; if they raise the quantity of one item to 5, then the bulk discount is only applied to that one item, not all of the others as well)

7. When there is a conflict between two discounts, the greater of the two will be applied.

Discounts table setup:
name - to have multiple types of discounts
percentage_off - amount as integer representing % discounted
min_quantity - the quantity that specifies before the discount is triggered
merchant_id - one(merchant) to many (discounts) relationship
item_id - will all later if time permits or could be a joins table




Addresses

  Need to create new table and make it so the address info is on that table and not the user table
  then can link the user_id to that Address table
